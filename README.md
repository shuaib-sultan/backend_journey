# User Management API (Flask + MySQL)

This project is a **User Management API** built with **Flask** and **MySQL**.  
The main purpose of this repository is to represent my **backend development journey**, starting from a clean and structured CRUD API and evolving into more advanced versions.

### Project Evolution

- v1.0 → Basic API
- v1.1 → JWT Authentication
- v1.2 → Middleware Authentication (By Decorators)
- v1.3 → Password hashing
- v2.0 → Logging system
---

## 📌 Features (Current Version)
### ✔ CRUD Operations  
- Create user  
- Retrieve all users  
- Retrieve user by ID  
- Retrieve user by email  
- Update user  
- Delete user  

### ✔ Clean Architecture  
- `models/` → SQL queries  
- `services/` → Business logic  
- `routes/` → Flask Blueprints  
- `utils/` → Validators + response helpers  
- `core/` → Custom errors + error handler  
- `database/` → MySQL connection & query wrapper  

### ✔ Error Handling  
Custom exception system:
- `ValidationError`
- `NotFoundError`
- `AuthenticationError`
- `PermissionError`
- `DatabaseError`

All errors are returned in a consistent JSON format.

### ✔ Input Validation  
The API validates:
- Email format  
- Data types  
- Empty fields  
- Password length  
- JSON body structure  

### ✔ JWT Authentication

- In this version I created a JWT (JSON Web Token) and return it to the user through the login or signup functions.
- I implemented a middleware decorator for authentication that checks whether the JWT in the request is valid or not. I also use it to verify the admin role of the request.

> I improved the authentication concept in my project and added middleware for better security.

### ✔ Save password in safe way  
I delet the password file in app folder couse i put all my passwords in safest way.
I put it in environment variables in the file .env

### ✔ Password hashing  
- I used the bcrypt module to save the users passwords in database in a safe way by 
hashing it . 
- The cod of hashing password and verifeing it in
```bash
utils/hash.py
```
## ✔ Logging system  
- I added to my API project a logging system to monitor my project form loginig and signing in . it save every error and important information in a files inside the log folder .

- I added alse a request logger to montior every request and respond  by useing the request hooks [after_request _ before_request] .

## 🚀 Running the Project

### 1) Create virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
### 2) Activate it

Windows
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux/Mac
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3) Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4) Run the server

python run.py
```
## 🛢 Database Configuration

Database settings are located in:
```bash
app/config.py
```
For safety, the file:
```bash
.env
``` 
>is ignored and **NOT nincluded** in the repository because it contains your database password.
